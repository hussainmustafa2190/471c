L3 is the version of the language that actually feels like a programming language you’d want to use. Since this is the very top of our compiler stack, it’s super high-level. The main thing I noticed in syntax.py is that everything is a "Term," and you can nest them however you want. It supports "first-class functions" (the Abstract and Apply stuff), which basically means functions are just values you can pass around like integers.

The coolest (and most complicated) part of L3 is LetRec. It’s basically the "magic" button for recursion. It lets you define functions that call themselves or even a bunch of functions that all call each other in a loop. At this stage, we don't have to worry about how the computer actually keeps track of variables; we just use Identifiers (names). Even memory feels abstract—we have Allocate and Load, but we’re just thinking in terms of "slots" or "indexes" rather than actual memory addresses. It’s a bit overwhelming how much is happening under the hood, but L3 hides all the messy hardware details from us.
