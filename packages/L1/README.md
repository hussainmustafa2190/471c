L1 is a massive wake-up call because the whole structure of the code changes. In L3 and L2, we had these deep "trees" where you could put an addition inside a function call inside another addition. In L1, that is totally banned. This is called "Administrative Flattening," and it's a huge simplification. We’ve basically flattened the program so it’s just a long list of Statements. You can't nest anything anymore.

This simplification forces a lot of elaboration in the code. Now, every single time we do an operation, we have to give the result a name using a destination. It’s like being forced to write math problems one tiny step at a time and saving the answer to a scrap of paper before you can move on. Also, every statement now has a then field. This is the "Continuation-Passing Style" we talked about in class. It’s basically a way of saying, "Do this step, then do the rest of the program." It’s starting to look way more like how a CPU actually works—one instruction at a time, in a straight line
