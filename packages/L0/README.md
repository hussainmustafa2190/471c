L0 is the final level before we hit actual Assembly, and it feels the most "real." The biggest simplification here is that we’ve deleted Abstract. In the earlier levels, we could just create a function whenever we wanted, but in L0, all code has to live in a Procedure at the very top level. We’ve basically destroyed the idea of "closures" where functions could see variables from the outside world.

To make this work, we had to do some elaboration by adding the Address statement. Since functions aren't "values" anymore, we use Address to find out where a procedure is stored so we can Call it later. The Program is now just a Sequence[Procedure], which I realized is exactly how a real binary file is organized—just a bunch of blocks of code. We’ve finally moved from "math-style" programming to "machine-style" programming. It’s definitely a lot less flexible than L3, but you can finally see how this would actually run on a physical chip.
